\begin_layout Standard
This brief document outlines the main features of the polarised nucleon
 scattering models implemented as an add-on to standard G4 nucleon reaction
 processes.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a polarised nucleon scatters off any nuclear target the spin-orbit
 potential results in a so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

up-down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left-right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asymmetry.
 The former results from a nucleon polarised in the horisontal plance while
 the latter the vertical plane.
 More precisley the asymmetry takes the form of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\phi$
\end_inset

 distribution where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is the azimuthal angle of the scattered nucleon around the incident momentum
 and with the zero of the distribution given by the incident polarisation
 plane :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N\left(\phi\right)=N_{0}\left(1+A_{p}P_{T}\cos\phi\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
here 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

analysing power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the interaction and it is dependent on the target species, nucleon momentum
 and scattering angle.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{T}$
\end_inset

 is the magnitude of the nucleon polarisation.
 Often one desires to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{T}$
\end_inset

 from such scattering reactions.
 To do so requires prior knowledge of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reactions up to several GeV 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{p}$
\end_inset

 is well determined for nucleon-nucleon scattering and there is a reasonable
 database for inclusive  scattering on Carbon.
 Everything else is not so well known.
 Even in the case of protons scattering on carbon the results are not so
 clear if the experiment is not measuring completely inclusive scattering
 or if it is sensitve to charge exchange processes.
 On the other hand what experimental evidence exists tends to suggest quasi-elas
tic scattering plays a dominant role in reactions where the nucleus is changed.
 This is particularly clear in charge exchange reactions where the scattered
 nucleon must have interacted with a nucleon inside the nucleus to exchange
 its charge with.
 But would also be enhanced by for example neutron scattering in an active
 scintillator, where the quasi-elastic scattering on the proton deposits
 significnalty more energy than elastic scattering on carbon or quasi elastic
 scattering on a neutron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering these factors it was decided to implement a quasi-elastic model
 based on the well known free nucleon-nucleon analysing powers to capture
 the main features of the reaction analysing power.
 Clearly this does not encapsulate all of the physics and so at the same
 time standard parameterisations usch as McNaughton have been implemented
 and can be blended with the quasi-elastic model or used a comparative result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GEANT4 libraries provide state-of-the-art particle tracking algorithms.
 The primary nucleon interaction models are based upon cascade processes
 where the nucleon interacts in a series of steps inside the nucleus.
 The resulting angular distribution was found to agree very well with data
 in the Sikora analysis.
 Such models do not consider the polarisation and hence it is necessary
 to apply an azimuthal distribtution after the final state has been determined.
 The analysing power for this comes from a parameterisation based on experimenta
l data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest case is for nucleon-nucleon scattering where the analysing
 power is well determined by the SAID PWA we use parameterisations of their
 results to determine the analysing power in these reactions.
 (Note for charge exchange reactions, this is equivalent to the original
 nucleon scattering backwards and so the analysing power for the forward
 charge exchanged nucleon should be taken from backward angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(180-\theta\right)$
\end_inset

then multiplied by -1.
 In this way the charge exchange reaction will have the same sign as the
 neutral exchange).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the quasi-elastic process the G4 inelastic model will in general produce
 multiple nucleons in the final state.
 We proceed by finding the two most energetic and assume these came from
 teh quasi-elastic scatter.
 Then the incident momentum and scatter angle of the most energetic nucleon
 is used to find the analysing power from the same SAID parameterisations.
 A new 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 angle is selected from the polarised distribution and the other reaction
 products rotated accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For elastic scattering off larger nuclei the quasi-free approach is not
 effective and different parameterisatons are needed.
 Currently we have several proton-Carbon analysing power paramterisations
 which can be used, although these may include effect other than pure pC
 elastic scattering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarily for inelastic scattering other paramterisation can be used instead
 of the quasifree method, Sikora is the most up-to-date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note care must be taken over reference frames.
 The phi angle is selected in the reaction centre of momentum.
 the z-axis is along the momentum direction, the y-axis momentum X labZ.
 The user must define the polarisation of the neutron in this frame, so
 be careful where z-lab is pointing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of the analysing power is handled by a new class PolNucleonRotate,
 which has flags for the different parameterisations that have been coded.
 This class returns the phi rotation required to put all of the particles
 in the polarised frame after the scatter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition there is a PolNPRotate class which specifically handles nucleon-nucl
eon elastic (and quasi) scattering.
